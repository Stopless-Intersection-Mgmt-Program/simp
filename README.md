You must have npm (Node Package Manager) or alternatives (yarn, nvm, etc) for installing package dependencies. Ideally the latest version of Node.js, React.js, and python3.
**Operating System must have python3 as a terminal command**

python = spawn('python3', ['-u scheduler.py'] => python = spawn('python', ['-u scheduler.py']
